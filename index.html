My journey started around one year ago. During this time i was shaping my skills by myself. I was practicing, experimenting (failing :)) and of course learning new things every day during this period. I don't know that U remember Your first steps, but trust me ,sometimes was really hard. And still is, because I know that is still a lot of new things which i need to master.

I know that I'm changing my path for around 359 degrees but I also know that is going to be really exciting and I'm looking forward for new challanges, proffesional challanges. Learning new things is just essential for me. I love it.
